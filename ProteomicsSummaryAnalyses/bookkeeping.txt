Functionalities to add:

1) Better differentiate summary and quality control measures.

2) Add Peptide/Protein Count Plots

3) Add Correlation Matrix

4) Add dashboard that shows important summary info and statistics spelled out with numbers and text

4) Add interactive functions to volcano plot and bar plot with plotly (ex hover to see gene names)

5) Try adding Interactive Heatmap Functionality (might be too bloated and better saved for a separate app)
