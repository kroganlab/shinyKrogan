# Krogan Lab R Shiny Tools

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package for building web apps to make data processing, exploration, and visualization in R accessible by a GUI for non-R-users. Shiny apps can be run locally from the source code in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or hosted on a server and accessed over the web. The links to apps on this page are hosted on a UCSF server and can only be accessed while logged in to a UCSF internet network. Non UCSF personnel will have to download the source code and run locally in RStudio or host the code on a shiny server ([shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/?_gl=1*yakayf*_ga*NzE3MDY1MjQ0LjE2ODMyMzYxMjc.*_ga_8QJS108GF1*MTY4MzMzNjAxNC4yLjEuMTY4MzMzNzU4My4wLjAuMA..*_ga_2C0WZ1JHG0*MTY4MzMzNjAxNC4yLjEuMTY4MzMzNzU4My4wLjAuMA..) is free and easy to use).
